# Portfolio Manager

The Linked Data Portfolio Manager is a powerful and intuitive tool designed to streamline the process of creating and managing employee portfolios within an organization. It serves as a centralized hub where companies, projects, and employees are interconnected through a sophisticated network of links, allowing for seamless collaboration and project tracking.

## Setup
This project exists out of a frontend & backend. Both repostiories you can find here:
* https://github.com/JonasVanHoof/portfolio-manager-frontend
* https://github.com/JonasVanHoof/portfolio-manager-backend

Clone both repositories in one directory and run `docker-compose up` in both of the projects. As the `compose.yml` files in both projects are putting their services on the `portfolio-manager` network the containers can work togheter seamlessly.
